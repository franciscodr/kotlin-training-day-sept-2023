# Effective Ktor with Kotlin
## Xebia: 22nd September 2023

This repository contains a series of independant Kotlin / Gradle projects, to be used on the [Effective Ktor with Kotlin](https://pages.xebia.com/kotlin-training-day) workshop at Xebia on 22nd September 2023.

Full details can be found in [the slide deck used to deliver the workshop](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y3jB7o4VjiBTGiRVtTQZgm8-Qbd0GVIlJ5Cm47qbYnM/edit?usp=sharing). The list below summarises the projects, in the order in which they will be introduced in the workshop:

* *ktor-fundamentals-start* - A basic Task Manager example in Ktor, with additional links to implement.
* *ktor-fundamentals-finish* - As above, but with the additional links implemented.
* *ktor-web-applications-start* - The example rewritten using Thymeleaf Templates, with extra functionaliy to implement.
* *ktor-web-applications-finish* - As above, but with the additional features implemented.
* *ktor-rest-start* - The example rewritten as a JavaScript Single Page Application interacting with a Ktor RESTful Service. With room for expansion.
* *ktor-rest-finish* - The above example, with full functionality
* *ktor-rest-with-testing* - The above example, refactored to support Dependency Injection. Which then allows us to create a suite of tests using the Ktor Test Framework.
* *ktor-compose-client* - A desktop UI, which uses Compose Multiplatform and the Ktor Client to interact with the RESTful service.
* *ktor-rest-exposed-start* - Our REST / SPA based application, but now talking to a PostgreSQL database via a repository implemented using the Exposed Framework. With two tasks to complete.
* *ktor-rest-exposed-finish* - The completed version of the above.

Please note that, after cloning this repository, you will need to make the *gradlew* scripts executable if you intend to build and run the projects manually.
